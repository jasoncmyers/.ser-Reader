# .ser File Reader

This is a library designed to allow a C++ program to access the binary .ser files output by the electron microscopy software TIA (previously ES Vision) used on FEI transmission electron microscopes.

Each of these files can contain multiple images and potentially spectra.  Working with these image stacks in an automated fashion is incredibly important for processing the large data cubes generated in hyperspectral imaging, and TIA itself provides very little support for exporting the data in an organized fashion.  Although I have seen several .ser reader plugins for assorted image processing software, I have not yet seen one that handles full image stacks gracefully, and most fail to import variations of the file, such as the 64-bit version.

This was originally designed to process a large (~1500 images) stack that had been generated by the TIA software with an unsigned/signed int coversion error (all high count pixels read as negative values).  This original program is still included as an example, but the library is in the process of being separated out to stand alone.
